# Blogger
My "Blogger" project is a REST Api of a blog platform, (NET Core 5), which follows
a principle of the Clean Architecture and implements the following functionalities: endpoints for CRUD operations,
connection with the SQL Server Database, versioning, paging, filtering, sorting, OData, mapping of DTOs
via AutoMapper, UI via Swagger.
Soon I am going to add authentication, authorization, JWT token functionality using Microsoft Identity.
In this project I used SQL Server as a database, choosing the Code First approach.
