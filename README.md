# Blogger
My "Blogger" project is a REST Api of a blog platform, (NET Core 5), which follows
a principle of the Clean Architecture and implements the following functionalities: endpoints for CRUD operations,
connection with the SQL Server Database, versioning, paging, filtering, sorting, OData, mapping of DTOs
via AutoMapper, UI via Swagger,authentication, authorization, JWT tokens using Microsoft Identity
As Database in this project I used SQL Server choosing the Code First approach..
